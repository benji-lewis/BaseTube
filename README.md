# BaseTube

## The Idea
A website that allows you to search YouTube but it takes your search string and base64 encodes it. There would also be an uploader function to allow you to upload a video with a base64 encoded title. Would be like a secret club that only people who know about it can access. But not through security, just through obscurity.

Could also be a Chrome extension. But it needs to be togglable
